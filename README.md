This is a guide on how to exploit or unblock something (or everything) on your school chromebook.

# IStealYourDNS (For WiFi-Based Blocking)
This is a cool "exploit" that uses DNS to unblock everything. This won't work for most people since its only for WiFi-Based blocking.
```
DNS1: 72.5.33.65
DNS2: 1.1.1.1
```
# SSL DISABLE (For Extension-Based Blocking)
Not many people know about this but if you disable SSL Certificates that blockers use, It won't fetch the block list making it still enabled but completely useless.
Securly: org-Amazon and org-Starfield Technologies, Inc. (org-Securly is useless if these are disabled)
Hapara: org-LetsEncrypt (DISABLING THIS MAKES TONS OF SITES NOT WORK BECUASE THEY USE LETS ENCRYPT)
# SH1MMER (TMM43 - Ultimate Destruction is a good song {wink wink})
SH1MMER is a exploit that lets you enable Developer Mode, Linux, Root and everything and destroy enrollment. It's hella awesome.
